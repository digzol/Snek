# Snek
Snek is the start of a game prototype I wrote back in 2019 to learn how to use Unity.
The original idea was to expand on a simple game mechanic (Snake) with my own touches.
The design was quickly influenced by 2006 Flash game "Flow" by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark.

Since Unity's engine couldn't handle the snake's fluid movement, I challenged myself to animate all parts directly.

There are currently no plans on finishing this prototype or turning it into a complete game, but future updates would include sandbox controls to customize the snake's appearance.
